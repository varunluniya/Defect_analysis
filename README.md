A dash-plotly app to find a scanned cat-code from a uploaded file.

The app is not tested for production but runs in development environment.

Working of app:
The takes one input from barcode scanner and other from uploaded file.
Then it searches the scanned catcode in uploaded file and diplays thoes test name(s) in which the scanned cta-code failed.

Being a new programmer in python and pandas I belive there is abeeter way to search in a dataframe.
I am working to make it roburst and I am also open to better suggestions.
